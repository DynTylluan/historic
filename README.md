# Historic Freedoom versions

This repository contains a collection of historic Freedoom releases and development snapshots.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some of these versions were removed from the Freedoom downloads page because
they were discovered to contain unauthorized / copyrighted resources that did not comply with
the Freedoom license. As such, you should exercise caution before reusing any of the contents
of these WADs.

Description of the filenames found in each subdirectory:

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| freedoom2.wad          | Freedoom IWAD file. Note that this has been renamed from doom2.wad to the modern filename used for Freedoom: Phase 2. |
| freedoom1.wad          | Freedoom "Demo" IWAD that contains the same resources as the Doom shareware version to give a more compact version of Freedoom. Note that this has been renamed from doom1.wad to the filename used for the more modern Freedoom: Phase 1. |
