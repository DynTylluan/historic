v0.1 release.

Please note that the IWAD is not included here, only the resource and the
levels PWADs. They cannot be used standalone and you will need a separate PWAD
to run them.

 `freedoom1.wad` is the "shareware" IWAD that was being built at the time (a
mini-IWAD that contained roughly the same resources as the Doom shareware IWAD,
so only Episode 1).
