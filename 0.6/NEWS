2008.02.28      v0.6

0.6 released.

2008.02.25      v0.6-rc2

Tagging -rc2. We've made a big change to the TEXTURE lump definitions.
We cut out all the multi-patch definitions as they were copied from
the doom data.  We made the decision not to cut out the single patch
definitions, as those are effectively a naming scheme (a 1-1
translation from patches to textures) and not copyrightable.

The texture data has been re-implemented using a cleanroom tool
(available in tools/cleanroom).

2008.01.03      v0.6-rc1

Tagging 0.6-rc1 as the first release candidate for the 0.6 release.
This will mostly be a maintenance release, but there are significant
level changes.

2006.09.02	v0.5

Freedoom 0.5 released (less than a year since 0.4!) Quite a few new
sprites. Placeholders for the sprites we haven't done yet that are
a bit better than the hovering box.

2006.03.03	v0.4.1

Bugfix release: a texture error prevented 0.4 from working properly in
some ports (prboom 2.2, eternity, possibly other early boom
derivatives). I have also taken this opportunity to update the
resource wads.

2005.12.27	v0.4

A belated christmas release: three new levels, a handful of new sounds
and a lot of work behind the scenes.

2004.12.25	v0.3

This Christmas release features new levels and sprites as well as
fixes for various bugs.

2003.12.10	v0.2

Changes in this release are mostly bugfixes. There are some new 
sprites, however, and two new levels. This release is 
celebrate Doom's 10th Anniversary.

2003.04.16	v0.1

Initial release
